# ðŸ§¬ biocomp

Bismillah, I dedicated this tutorial for my parents. Hopefully this tutorial can be useful and can be sadaqah jariyah for my parents. 

## About

biocomp is a repository for my bioinformatics and computational biology learning journey. This repository includes scripts and data primarily focused on computational biology, covering a wide range of topics such as:

-   Metagenomics: Tools and scripts for analyzing metagenomic data.
-   Phylogenetics: Methods for phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary studies.
-   Ecology: Scripts for ecological data analysis and visualization.
-   Data Visualization: Examples and tutorials on visualizing biological data effectively.
-   and many more

I am continuously updating this repository as I learn and explore more in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. I would be very happy to receive comments or ideas, and I am also available for collaboration!

Remember to give a stars if you found this helpful.
